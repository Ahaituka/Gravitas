"description": "3-D Printing has been dubbed as the technology of the future! Indeed it has many reasons that advocate the stance. It is currently the best rapid manufacturing technology for personalised manufacturing and rapid prototyping and is slowly finding its way into the industry. It has been predicted that it will be the harbinger of the 3rd industrial revolution.\nTo familiarise students with this modernistic and cutting-edge technology and to teach them about the basics of 3-D Printing, is the desideratum of this workshop. The workshop will be attended by students from a large verity of branches including computer, electrical, IT, mechanical, civil and even biotech engineering! This goes to show the vast appeal of this technology. \nThe workshop shall havedistinguished guests coming from international companies. The introductory session, consisting of basics of 3-D Printing and additive manufacturing, processes, materials and printers used in the process, 3-D Printers set up during the workshop will demostrate the technology to the students live. The next session will introduce the participants to basics of CAD software designing and slicing technique. The students will be given several useful softwares and taught to design their own objects. The third session, focusses specifically on Metal RP (Rapid Prototyping). The students shall be shown several high grade metal components made using titanium and aluminium. After the lunch break, the fourth session, consisting of 3-D scanning, will showcase state of the art 3-D scanners. At the end the students will have the hands-on sessions with the scanners and printers. This is the most interesting and exciting part for the participants, because most of them haven’t seen or used a 3-D Printer before. The participants also get their designed models 3-D printed given to them as mementos!\nThey will surely looking forward to explore more frontiers of this very unique technology!",

"description": "Event Details : \nThe event electri-City is essentially a technical event which involves breaking codes to debug errors and make a functional electrical circuit. \n\nROUND 1\nThe first round is essentially an elimination round which involves a test which is used to determine the basic knowledge of the participants in the electrical and electronics field. Participants will take part in teams of 2 or individually.\n40 questions will be asked and based on the results of the test, 10 teams will be selected for the 2nd round.\n\nROUND 2\n\nIn the 2nd round each team will be provided with a city map. The different monuments , landmarks ,buildings will represent the different electrical components that will go into making the circuit .The items will not be mentioned directly but in the form of codes which will require them to first decode the code to determine the item and then connect them correctly on the circuit board.\n\nEx: A 100 ohm resistor can be represented as !))  666-444-6. Here the participants are expected to guess that 100 is got from the symbolic representation on the keyboard and �ohm� is got by typing the text on the mobile keypad with the T9 dictionary switched off.\nAlso the circuit elements such as the IC-555 timer cannot be connected directly unless one knows the basic pin terminology thus testing the participant knowledge in the field. \nThe city map will be divided into 3-Zones: Industrial, Residential and Commercial. The city layout will be toyed with and the participants will have to correctly debug the errors in the city planning to finally obtain a correct circuit design which when implemented will give a correct output.\n \nFor Ex:  A children�s park placed in the industrial area and the toxic waste disposal in the residential area are not expected traits of a well planned city and therefore have to be rearranged to obtain the correct circuit.\n\nRules and Regulations\n\nThe event will be conducted in two rounds:\n\nFirst Round : \nBasic knowledge test\n \n1) Maximum of 2 participants per team.\n2) Time Limit : 30 minutes \n3) Use of mobiles prohibited.\n4) Total 40 questions (MCQ and fill in the blanks format) with no negative marking for an incorrect answer.\n\nA total of 10 teams will qualify for the next round.\n\nSecond Round:\n\n1)  Only 1 map will be provided per team.\n2)  Time limit: 1 hour\n3)  All the required components will be provided to the participants on their request.\n4)  First team to debug and show the final output will be declared the winner.\n5)  If none of the teams get the desired output then depending on the extent of debugging  the winner will be determined.\n\nRaw Materials and Event Budget\n\nLab Components (Breadboards, Resistors, ICs, Transistors, LEDs, Capacitors) � Rs. 1000\nPhotocopies and Print-outs � Rs. 300\nA4 Sheets, Pens,Banners",

It consists of a single round and both the participants of the team enter the arena together solving through the maze. Both of them complete a segment of the course and reach a point where they separate. At this point the participants have to make a quick decision which one will go through which path. One of the course will consist of lasers and sensors whereas in the other the participant will have to cross through a demanding track made of ropes, tyres and bamboos. The event requires good co-ordination among the team members. The scoring is based on the number of lasers, sensors left undisturbed as well as how well the Rope track has been crossed. The team to finish the course in least time possible as well as complete the tasks efficiently is declared a winner.\n\nSOCIAL PERSPECTIVE\nWhen the participants open the money vault, they surprisingly find no money but rather old clothes which they need to choose one out of them and the cloths would be given to the needy by their name bringing out a social initiative in the event. Though the winners are declared by the least time taken but adding this kind of surprise would be a meaningful initiative taken up in the event.",

They have to mutually decide which person will play the Jenga puzzle and which will code the given question.\nEach Jenga stick will have a certain time written on it. The coder will get to type for the amount of time the team has.\nSo for example, the Jenga guy pulls a stick for 2 mins, the coder gets to code for 2 mins uninterrupted after which he'll be paused, until the Jenga guy pulls another stick. This will force the game to happen at a fast pace and cause chances of the Jenga stack to fall down. If this scenario arises the other team gets a time bonus to code while the team which made it fall will be stopped until they rebuild the Jenga tower.\nThe difficulty level of the questions will be easy to medium considering they're first years with hardly any coding experience.",

"description": "The basic idea was to attract more first year students for a coding event. And therefore in place of high-level coding questions which are a major part of coding events, the questions were simple and the almost similar to the ones they were already taught in class. The main part of the event was that the keys of the keyboard were jumbled up, that is, they were mapped according to an algorithm which the participants had to detect and then write the correct code for the problem. The concept  introduced in Jumble Coding is that the algorithm used is not constant; it changed depending on certain fixed events.\nThe participants were judged on the basis of correctness of their code and the time taken to solve the given problem. The event had an amazing response from not only CSE or IT students but also from the students of other branches.",
